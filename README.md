Q1: Identify FRs and NFRs:
The institute was recently established to offer cutting-edge research facilities in the area of software engineering. In addition to research scholars (students) and professors, it also contains a sizable workforce that works on various initiatives carried out by the university. It has been suggested to create a Library Information System (LIS) for the benefit of institute personnel and students given the growing size and capability of the institution. The members will be able to easily borrow and return books while seated at their desks or meeting rooms thanks to LIS. If no other booking has been made for that particular book, the system also allows a member to prolong the date of his borrowing. This technology helps the library personnel manage daily book transactions more simply. The system is entirely under the authority of the librarian, who has administrative rights and may add new records whenever a new book is bought or erase records whenever a book is removed from the shelf. This technology allows non-members to freely browse and search books online. But only authorised users (LIS members) are permitted to issue or return books. The end product would be a web application (using the most recent HTML 5) that could only be used inside the institute LAN. Although this greatly lowers the software's security risk, care should be taken to ensure that no sensitive data (such as passwords) is saved in plain text.


Functional Requirements-: 

1) The Library Information System (LIS) should be developed efficiently in accord to the increasing number of students & books .
2) In any case of data leak the system should collapse to prevent the data from leaking.
3) The administrator must have all the privileges to remove and allow any user, regarding any book.
4) A proper maintenance of the book issuing and the validation of the membership should be kept.
5) A verification of the user should be done.
6) Visitors to the library should be allowed, but they should be asked for their membership before being given access to the books.
7) The present books and new books should be updated.
8) "Periodicals" to be controlled include newspapers, journals, and other publications with a regular publication schedule. Its duty is to handle the publications in an appropriate manner.r


Non-Functional Requirements-: 

1) Usability: Usability is the main non-functional need for a library management system. Without additional instruction, everyone need to be able to comprehend the        user interface (UI) and locate the required data. Other languages may be supplied based on demand.
2) To make login into the system more efficient, users should be given the opportunity to store passwords.
3) The algorithm of the system should be able to suggest books to the user based on the data it gathers from both the user's wishlist and history.
4) The software must be as simple to add new features and modify as possible, and it should be simple to maintain. Additionally, the software needs to be portable.
5) System should be endowed with the notify feature so that the user can get to know when the desired book will be available.
6) System should be able to minimize the output lag and execute the query as soon as possible.
7) Adding any new feature to the system should be simple.
8) The system should be fast enough to solve the query of the user.



Q2: Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.

Approximately 5% of the world population (or a staggering 466 million people) suffers from disabling hearing loss. We set out to create an impactful solution for this community that addresses some of their everyday needs. Our mobile application uses artificial intelligence to recognize key sound events of interest to this community, such as car horns and babies, where immediate alerts and continual logging are critical for the user. This app is optimized for Android with low-latency so that it works in real-time for use.



Scope:

1) There should be an initiative to make a smartphone app for those who have hearing loss.
2) To recognise significant sound occurrences, such as car horns and babies, use artificial intelligence should be promoted. 



Features: 

1) Provides prompt alerts for locating sound events.
2) The users who are suffering benefit from continuous logging..
3) Preserving information about sound events for future usage.


Non-Functional Aspects:

1) Working immediately.
2) Made with Android in mind.
3) Real-time functioning is ensured via low latency.
