Q1: Identify FRs and NFRs:
The institute was recently established to offer cutting-edge research facilities in the area of software engineering. In addition to research scholars (students) and professors, it also contains a sizable workforce that works on various initiatives carried out by the university. It has been suggested to create a Library Information System (LIS) for the benefit of institute personnel and students given the growing size and capability of the institution. The members will be able to easily borrow and return books while seated at their desks or meeting rooms thanks to LIS. If no other booking has been made for that particular book, the system also allows a member to prolong the date of his borrowing. This technology helps the library personnel manage daily book transactions more simply. The system is entirely under the authority of the librarian, who has administrative rights and may add new records whenever a new book is bought or erase records whenever a book is removed from the shelf. This technology allows non-members to freely browse and search books online. But only authorised users (LIS members) are permitted to issue or return books. The end product would be a web application (using the most recent HTML 5) that could only be used inside the institute LAN. Although this greatly lowers the software's security risk, care should be taken to ensure that no sensitive data (such as passwords) is saved in plain text.


Functional Requirements-: 

1) The Library Information System (LIS) should be developed efficiently in accord to the increasing number of students & books .
2) In any case of data leak the system should collapse to prevent the data from leaking.
3) The administrator must have all the privileges to remove and allow any user, regarding any book.
4) A proper maintenance of the book issuing and the validation of the membership should be kept.
5) A verification of the user should be done.
6) Visitors to the library should be allowed, but they should be asked for their membership before being given access to the books.
7) The present books and new books should be updated.
8) "Periodicals" to be controlled include newspapers, journals, and other publications with a regular publication schedule. Its duty is to handle the publications in an appropriate manner.r


Non-Functional Requirements-: 

1) Usability: Usability is the main non-functional need for a library management system. Without additional instruction, everyone need to be able to comprehend the        user interface (UI) and locate the required data. Other languages may be supplied based on demand.
2) To make login into the system more efficient, users should be given the opportunity to store passwords.
3) The algorithm of the system should be able to suggest books to the user based on the data it gathers from both the user's wishlist and history.
4) The software must be as simple to add new features and modify as possible, and it should be simple to maintain. Additionally, the software needs to be portable.
5) The system ought to have a notification option so that users may be informed when their desired books become accessible.
6) The system must be able to reduce output latency and quickly perform the query.
7) It should be easy to include new features into the system.


Q2: Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.

A astounding 466 million individuals, or almost 5% of the world's population, are affected with hearing loss that is incapacitating. We set out to provide a useful solution for this group that takes care of some of their basic requirements. When a user needs rapid warnings and ongoing logging, our mobile application employs artificial intelligence to identify important sound occurrences of relevance to this group, such automobile horns and newborns. This software is designed for Android and has low latency so that it may be used immediately.


Scope:

1) A project should be launched to create a smartphone app for those with hearing loss.
2) Artificial intelligence should be encouraged in order to recognise important sound occurrences like newborns and automobile horns.



Features: 

1) Quick notifications are given for finding sound events.
2) The continual logging is advantageous to the users who are suffering.
3) Saving details about audio occurrences for later use.

Non-Functional Aspects:

1) Starting work right away.
2) Designed just for Android.
3) Low latency ensures real-time operation.
